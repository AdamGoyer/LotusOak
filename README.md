# Lotus Oak Foundation 🌸🌳

A platform for regenerative philanthropy, aligned investing, and cultural stewardship.

## Ethos

The oak stands firm,  
While the lotus blooms—it swiftly fades.  
Endurance and ephemerality,  
A dance of strength and grace.

Rooted in the wisdom of ages—  
East and West, ancient and modern—  
We blend traditional philanthropy with social venture strategies to support projects in education, healthcare, environmental conservation, and cultural renewal.

# Donor Advised Funds: A Modern Approach to Philanthropy

## What is a Donor Advised Fund?

A Donor Advised Fund (DAF) is a philanthropic vehicle that allows donors to make charitable contributions, receive immediate tax benefits, and then recommend grants to qualified charities over time. Think of it as a charitable investment account for your philanthropic dollars.

## How DAFs Work

1. **Contribution**
   - Make an irrevocable contribution to your DAF
   - Receive an immediate tax deduction
   - Your contribution grows tax-free

2. **Investment**
   - Your funds are professionally managed
   - Choose from various investment strategies
   - Watch your charitable dollars grow

3. **Granting**
   - Recommend grants to qualified charities
   - Support causes you care about
   - Make grants on your own timeline

# Donor Advised Funds: A Flexible Tool for Intentional Giving

At the Lotus Oak Foundation, we use Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) as a flexible structure to support values-driven philanthropy. While the concept of a DAF is often associated with large financial institutions, our approach is deeply personal, guided, and mission-aligned.

## What is a Donor Advised Fund?

A Donor Advised Fund is a giving account established at a public charity. Donors contribute assets, receive an immediate tax deduction, and retain advisory privileges over how grants are recommended—while the foundation manages the investments and final disbursements.

## How We Use DAFs at Lotus Oak

Unlike commercial DAF platforms, we take a relational, high-touch approach:

- We begin with meaningful dialogue to understand your vision and goals.
- Our CIO personally oversees the investment strategy to align with your intentions.
- Our advisors work collaboratively with you to identify and support outstanding nonprofit projects.
- We handle administration, due diligence, and compliance—so you can focus on impact.

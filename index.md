# Welcome to Lotus Oak Foundation ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ³

The oak stands firm,  
While the lotus bloomsâ€”it swiftly fades.

Endurance and ephemerality,  
A dance of strength and grace.

Neither wholly masculine nor feminine,  
Their virtues transcend boundaries.

Rooted in the wisdom of ages,  
East and West, ancient and modern,  
Echoing the eternal Tao.
